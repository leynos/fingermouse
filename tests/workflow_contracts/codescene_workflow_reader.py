"""Read GitHub workflow files strictly, for the CV-005 contract.

Only `read_workflows` touches the disk; everything else is pure over parsed
documents, so the rules in `codescene_pull_request_rules` and
`codescene_publisher_rules` can be driven over mutated copies as readily as
over this repository's files.

A reading that finds nothing is a fault of the reader, not a pass: every rule
built on these readings is a refusal, and a refusal over an empty subject set
is satisfied by any repository at all. Those faults raise `WorkflowError`.
