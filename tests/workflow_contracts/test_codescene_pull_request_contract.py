"""Prove the pull-request half of CV-005: no lane a PR starts reaches CodeScene.

The first test judges this repository's workflows. Every other test mutates a
copy of them in the way a later edit could, or feeds the reader a document it
must refuse, and asserts that the clause meant to catch that edit does. A clause
no mutation fails is indistinguishable from one never written.
