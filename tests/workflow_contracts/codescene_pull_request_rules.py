"""Hold every CodeScene contact off the pull-request lanes (CV-005).

CV-005 moves every CodeScene call off the pull-request lanes. A pull request
generates coverage for its own ratchet and nothing else. The reason is the call
rather than the artefact: the shared uploader pins the cs-coverage archive by
digest, but the client talks to CodeScene's API and refuses to run when that
answer changes shape, which has happened twice. Keeping the call on the trunk
keeps such a change off every pull request's critical path.

Each rule is a pure function from parsed workflow documents to a list of
violations.
