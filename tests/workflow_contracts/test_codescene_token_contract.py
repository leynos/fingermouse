"""Prove where the publisher may name CS_ACCESS_TOKEN, and what the jobs may hold.

No `env` binds the token. A check step runs one exact command that Actions
expands to `available=true` or `available=false`, and the token reaches the
uploader only as its `access-token` input: the uploader is a composite action,
so a token in its step's `env` would reach the nested `upload-artifact` and
cache steps too. Every test mutates a copy of this
repository's workflows and asserts that the clause meant to catch the edit
does.
